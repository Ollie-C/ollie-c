<p align="center">ðŸ‘‹ I'm a London-based developer with a passion for creating unique, seamless apps that hold altruistic value and that motivate and inspire. I am a seasoned Tokyo morning commuter, long-time gamer and enjoyer of mountains</p>

### Where am I [update 20/03/2025]? 

As of April 2023, I became a full-time software developer starting out at a fun creative agency and then moving on to do my own thing. We used Gitlab so I don't have as many green squares as I would like on my Github profile. Having recently found my footing as a father, I am now using my newly acquired 30 minutes free time each day to work on some personal projects. 

I put my Myvu app on hold to experiment a bit with the most recent AI tools and have built myself a productivity app - one with a simple interface - that will help me get back into a routine. 

So cookie-cutter projects and AI-assisted coding - **how very unexciting** I hear you say. Well, these are slowly making way for better things. As well as Myvu, there is also a tea-themed app in the pipeline - a joint venture with the wife and I as we prepare for life again in Japan. 

Absolutely more to come. Watch this space.

### Where is my coding going? 

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on: a <a href="https://github.com/Ollie-C/myvu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">social movie ranker</a> in Next, TypeScript and GraphQL. 
- ðŸŒ± Learning: React Query, Three.js, a bit of theory 

### These don't exactly define who I am, but they definitely help me build cool apps
