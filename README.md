### Hi there, I'm Ollie ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ (in case the banner didn't give it away) 

I'm a London-based junior fullstack developer with a love for nature and a passion for creating unique, seamless apps that hold altruistic value and that motivate and inspire. Lived in Japan, bit of a gamer, chemex for coffee, snowboarding, reading, all that jazz (jazz too).

I've always loved working with computers and have since swallowed my regrets of not having done CS at uni, realised age is just an int, and made a career change and will never look back.  ðŸ‘€

(hope it's a banger)

## Bit more about me I guess? 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a social movie ranker / letterboxd clone in Next.js as I can't live without lists and I know there are others out there like me
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the benefits of TypeScript
