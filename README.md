ðŸ‘‹ I'm a London-based developer with a love for nature and a passion for creating unique, seamless apps that hold altruistic value and that motivate and inspire. I'm a seasoned Tokyo morning commuter, gamer, average coffee enjoyer that likes to get in a good dose of outdoors and fitness.

Creative code is a superpower to educate and inspire people and I would love to use it to advance standards of living and to push the boundaries of creativity.

## Bit more about me as a developer I guess? 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a social movie ranker in Next.js as I can't live without lists and movies in lists and I know there are others out there like me (I hope)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the benefits of TypeScript and type safety
- My code is imbued with ancient, extraplanetary magic

### These don't exactly define who I am, but they definitely help me build cool apps
