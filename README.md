[![MasterHead](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ollie-C/ollie-c/main/banner.png)](https://github.com/Ollie-C)

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a London-based junior frontend developer with a love for nature and a passion for creating unique, seamless apps that hold altruistic value and that motivate and inspire. I'm a seasoned Tokyo morning commuter, long-time gamer, filter coffee...drinker that loves all the good stuff: snowboarding, reading, movies etc.

Creative code is a superpower to educate and inspire people and I would love to see it advance standards of living including enabling a balanced, sustainable living.

(hope it's a banger)

## Bit more about me as a developer I guess? 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a social movie ranker in Next.js as I can't live without lists and movies in lists and I know there are others out there like me (I hope)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the benefits of TypeScript and type safety

### These don't exactly define who I am, but they definitely help me build cool apps
