<p align="center">ðŸ‘‹ I'm a London-based developer with a passion for creating unique, seamless apps that hold altruistic value and that motivate and inspire. I am seasoned Tokyo morning commuter, long-time gamer and enjoyer of scenic mountains</p>

<p align="center">Creative code is a superpower to educate and inspire people and want it to be used to bring back balanced, sustainable living and to push the boundaries of creativity</p>

### Where is my coding going? 

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on: a <a href="https://github.com/Ollie-C/myvu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">social movie ranker</a> in Next, TypeScript and GraphQL. 
- ðŸŒ± Would love to try: Svelte and SvelteKit

### These don't exactly define who I am, but they definitely help me build cool apps
