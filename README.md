<p align="center">ðŸ‘‹ I'm a London-based developer with a passion for creating unique, seamless apps that hold altruistic value and that motivate and inspire. I am a seasoned Tokyo morning commuter, long-time gamer and enjoyer of mountains</p>

### Where am I [update 08/24]? 

As of April 2023, I began working full-time as a software developer for an awesome creative agency. My focus turned to the job for a good period of time and the team there uses Gitlab. Myvu (my side project) had to be put on hold. The moment I found my feet (and some time at the weekend), my son was born into the world. 

He's now 8 months old and has sent me into overdrive (25 hours a day, 26 of which are spent looking after him) but for whatever reason, life is starting to settle again. 

My work life has made me a better coder. Having said that, yesterday I found out the hard way why we should not rush our git add . + git commit routine because it creates the mythical "git commit ." , destroyer of souls, negater of productivity. 

Somehow I have found time and with that time I'll be restarting Myvu (a movie ranker app). After that I have another project, currently with the design team (my wife), that I'd like to give a go. One for tea enthusiasts. 

Watch this space.

### These don't exactly define who I am, but they definitely help me build cool apps
